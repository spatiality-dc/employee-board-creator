## User-Story

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Challenge

Trying to differentiate in my own head when to use the "super" keyword as a function and when to use it as an object was tough.

## Screenshots

The command line application can be seen in the gif below.

- Javascript is still hard.

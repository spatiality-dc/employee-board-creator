## User-Story

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was trying to keep a clear naming structure when creating Objects and Classes.

Using Async functions to build out the HTML for a page, dependent on user input, was also a wee bit confusing. For the longest time I was only able to generate the components but return "Undefined" values.

## Lessons Learned

- Using classes to inherit features is useful in quickly building out dynamic aspects of web pages. But adding in overrides and restrictions can be a bit difficult to comprehend.

- Javascript is still hard.
